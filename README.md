# Airport Network Management System
A Java application that models a network of airports and flights, featuring a Swing-based GUI for user interaction.
The system allows for searching airport information and analyzing flight connections.
The codebase also contains an experimental implementation for visualizing the network as a graph.


## Key Features

*   **Central Registry:** Manages all airport and flight data in a centralized system.
*   **Airport Search:** Allows users to retrieve detailed information about an airport by searching for its city.
*   **Flight Path Analysis:** Calculates and displays both direct and indirect flight connections between two destinations.
*   **Data Export:** Generates a `.txt` file with the results of a flight search for record-keeping.

### Archived Experimental Feature
The source code in `FindAirportFrame.java` includes a commented-out feature to visualize the airport network using the JUNG (Java Universal Network/Graph) Framework.
This code is preserved as an artifact of the project's development but remains as a comment in the current version.

#### Technologies & Libraries
*   **Core:** Java
*   **GUI:** Java Swing
*   **Archived Code:** The JUNG Framework was used for the unimplemented visualization feature.

## Prerequisites
*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

### How to Run
The simplest way to run this project is by using an IDE that supports Java, such as Eclipse.
1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  Open the project in your IDE.
3.  Locate and run the `Main.java` file within the `src` folder.

#### Attribution and Academic Context

**Please Note:** This project was originally completed as an assignment for the **Object-Oriented Programming** course at **University of Macedonia**.
The project's initial requirements and some code were provided by the course instructors.
My contribution involved the design and implementation of the core data structures, algorithms, and user interface to meet the assignment's objectives.
